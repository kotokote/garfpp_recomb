Hi Yasu,

I've attached the two python scripts (100el*py) I used to generate the data in the chart attached - one for 100% xenon and one for 2% TMA and 98% xenon at 5 atm for a wide range of electric fields. They run batchTotal number of clouds per condition (here 10 100 electron-ion pair clouds). I left the walltime at max (48h), but not all of the jobs run that long. Running both scripts as is returns 480 jobs and takes several thousand computing hours and about two days to finish.

​The awk script I attached is an example of how I pull the data from the .out files to put information on the final state of all electrons into a root file, and the .cc file has the variables for the root file set up as I use them if you want to do that.​

getrecombsline.py grabs the recombination percentages for all of the clouds, as are plotted in the graph attached. I am writing a script to put this information in a root file too, but haven't finished it yet.

​Let me know if you can think of a better way to do things (especially if something seems incorrect!), since I've been learning this environment as I go.​
